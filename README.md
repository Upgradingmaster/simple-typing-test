# SimpleTypingTest

## About
---
This is a basic typing test tool designed to be *lightweight*, fast, ***minimal***, and configurable.
It is intended for users who prefer a minimal and offline solution to tracking their typing skill.

Compared to a fully fledged typing tests which would have features you may not need, 
this application focuses on getting the job done by tracking a select few variables well.

## (Intended) features
---
- Tracks various statistics
- Save statistics of your tests
- Visualize progress with a progress graph
- Configure your tests to your preference. (Duration and Word Count)
- Easily visualize your mistakes with a "Diff" view to compare the errors at the character level

## What
---
Essentially the program generates a random string of words outputs it to stdout or a user interface.
It then reads intput from the user (stdin/ui).
After this, variables related to speed and accuracy are calculated and stored in a Statistic object
This object is stored in a collection of Statistics
The user can take multiple tests
The statistics can be viewed later by the user to get an overview of their progress.


## Why
---
I chose to create this mainly since I think this idea has the potential to involve a range of different ideas from Software Development, Computer Science and Mathematic, leading me to learn a variety of skills.
Although this seems laughable due to the simple nature of the project I've described above, I have intentionally limited the scope of the project due to the course's requirements (with respect to the project) and for the sake of time.
However I do plan to expand on the project after the completion of the course.

I also have an interest in open-source, bloat-free, simple, but powerful terminal-based applications. 
It is also the case that I recently have started training my typing speed.
